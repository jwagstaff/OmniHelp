One of the main benefits of upgrading your account is to get more storage space for your projects. 
You can upgrade your account in the **plans and billings** section in your **account management**. 


Upgrading from the **free individual account** to the **paid freelancer account** will increase the storage space for your designs from **100MB to 5GB**.
