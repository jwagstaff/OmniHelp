The **Collaboration** features allows other users on omnibuilds to access your designs and make changes. 

To add a collaborator to a **Design Settings** and to the section that says **collaborators**. Make sure to insert the correct user's email address as they will automatically be added as a collaborator.

If the email address is not associated with an omnibuilds user, it will send an invite link to their email to join the platform to collaborate on the design.

Collaborators will not be able to delete designs. Designs can only be deleted by the original creator.
