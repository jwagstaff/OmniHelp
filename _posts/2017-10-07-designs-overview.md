OmniBuilds is a tool for tracking engineering designs. Every thing in OmniBuilds is ultimately a design, whether it a single part, an entire project, or any level of assembly in between. Naming conventions are a question of perspective. Designs can be organized into three main classes based on their relationship to one another:

**Projects** -- typically the root or highest level

**Assemblies** -- Associated under the project class and consists of parts

**Parts** -- the lowest level and contains no lower designs

A **versioning system** is applied to every design and all of its subcomponents to keep track of the numerous changes a hardware design may undergo.

The OmniBuilds **collaboration feature** allows multiple people to make changes, comment, and access a single design.
