CAD files or other important files can be uploaded to any type of OmniBuilds design (Project, Assembly, or Part).  

Omnibuilds is **CAD agnostic** meaning any type of file can be uploaded to the a design. 

Common design file types may include: DXF, DWG, PRD, TIFF, HPGL, IGES, STEP, and STL files, but you are free to use any file format that is consistent with your design process.


**To add files to your design:**

1. Click on the the **files tab** on the design dashboard
2. Click the **add files** button or upload **new files** button if there are files already present 
3. Select the file you wish to add 
4. The file will then be uploaded and listed in the files tab of the specific design



**You will then have the ability too:**

- **Download** the file from any device using your OmniBuilds account.  
- **Upload** a new version of the file at any time
- See the **version history** of uploaded files (List of any updates or changes to a specific file)
- **Delete** the file from the design

Realize collaborators will have these same abilities when working together on designs.
