Designs in Omnibuilds were meant to be shared between different projects and can be added as parts or assemblies in multiple projects. Say we have a specific part such as a "nut" that would be ideal to be used in all our hardware projects. The "nut" Part Design can be put into the BOM of any project we create on Omnibuilds.

Once a part, assembly or project design is created it will be searchable in the **Design Library Search Bar**.

You can also add previously created parts or assemblies to a design's Bill of Materials. Type in the first couple of letters of the name and the part or assembly will auto-populate under the input. Click on the part or assembly you wish to add to the bill of materials and it will be successful added.

You can also export a specific design into another Project's Bill of Materials by clicking the **Export** button on the top right of the design dashboard screen. Once clicked you have to designate which Project or Assembly the design will go.
