Omnibuilds offers free accounts for public users and open source projects, as well as paid accounts that offer more storage space and privately hosted designs.


### **Signing up for the account** ###


1. Go to the [OmniBuild's Home page](HTTP://www.omnibuilds.com) and click the sign up button

2. Once on the signup page, create a *unique username* with an associated email and password. Your OmniBuild's username may only contain English letters, numbers, and @/./+/-/_ characters. Please be aware the account login username may only be created once and cannot be changed. An email address can only be associated with one unique username.

3. After you have created your username with email and password, you will be taken to your Omnibuilds dashboard. From here you can utilize the full functionality of a public account and will be able to upgrade your personal account or upgrade to an organization account.
