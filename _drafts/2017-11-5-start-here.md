## Why We Created OmniBuilds
---
If you work in the field of hardware engineering, you are likely to interact with one or more  projects containing a Bill of Materials (BOM), Computer Aided Design (CAD) Files, and documentation on a daily basis.  

Unless you can afford an enterprise PLM system you will have a limited set of options to colloborate on and control revisions for these projects. You may have tried everything from email, to shared drives, to git, to websites like GrabCAD, OpenBOM, and Dozuki but were left thinking there must be a better way. 

We've been there too, and that's what led us to create a tool that was as powerful as an enterprise grade PLM yet still affordable and easy enough to learn for anyone to use.

## What OmniBuilds Allows You To Do
---
In the simplest terms, OmniBuilds allows you to do the following:

> Stop tracking your Bill of Materials in a spreadsheet
>
> Stop sharing CAD files via email or a shared drive
>
> Manage and publish revisions down to the individual part
>
> Collaborate with other users in a secure private setting
