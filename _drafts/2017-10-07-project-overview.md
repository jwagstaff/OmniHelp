The OmniBuilds project is designed to contain all hardware parts, BOMS (bill of materials), cad files, specs, and any other pertinent information relating to a specific hardware project. 

A versioning system is applied to every project and all of its subcomponents to keep track of the numerous changes a hardware project may undergo.

The OmniBuilds collaboration feature allows multiple people to make changes, comment, and access one single project. 


The project is typically the root or the highest level of the hierarchy but there may be some use cases where it can be embedded into other projects.
