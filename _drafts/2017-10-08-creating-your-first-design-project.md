Create a new project by following either of the steps below:

- Click the **"New Project Button"** on your dashboard in the projects library

-  Click on **"New Project"** in the User Settings and Shortcut menu where the person icon is located

You will be able to give any name you want to a project, but try to be specific as possible to properly track every one you create.

Once a project is created it will be visible in the project library on your dashboard. It will then be searchable in your **Design Library Search Bar**.

For every type of account you can have an unlimited number of projects in your library.
