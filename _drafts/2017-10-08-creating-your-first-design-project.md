The OmniBuilds project is designed to contain all hardware parts, BOMS (bill of materials), cad files, specs, and any other pertinent information relating to a specific hardware project. A versioning system is applied to every project and all of its subcomponents to keep track of the numerous changes a hardware project may undergo. The OmniBuilds collaboration feature allows multiple people to make changes, comment, and access one single project. The project is typically the root or the highest level of the hierarchy but there may be some use cases where it can be inbedded into other projects. 

You can create new projects by the following:

1. Clicking the new project button on your dashboard in the projects library
2. Clicking on New Project in the User Settings and Shortcut menu where the person icon is located

You will be able to give any name you want to a project, but try to be specific as possible to properly track every one you create.

Once you have created your first project you will be able to see it in your project library on your dashboard. It will be searchable in your design library search bar as well.
