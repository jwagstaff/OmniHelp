One of the great benefits of using OmniBuilds is the ability create multiple versions of designs. The versioning system will take snapshots of all changes made to a design. 

If you finished the first prototype of a design project and want to preserve all the designs (including sub-assemblies and parts) to reference in the future you can use the **revise**  tool. Below are two options for accessing this tool:

- Click the **revise** located at the top right part of the **Design Dashboard**. 

- In the **Design Settings** navigate towards the **Revisions** section and click **Create New Revision**.

You will then name the revision and add a description for it as well. 

If you ever want to see all the revisions you have created you can view them in **Revisions** section in the **Design Settings**.


One great benefit of using revisions is you can input a previous version of a specific part in the Project's Bill of Materials. Imagine having to change a certain part due to a supplier being out of stock at the time. Whenever the specific part is back in stock, you would be able to select previous version of a part in the Project's Bill of Materials.
