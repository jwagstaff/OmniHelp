Revision Control can be very helpful when you wish to preserve previous versions of your hardware project but what if you want to split the hardware project in two different directions.  This is where cloning becomes extremely helpful.

the **Cloning tool** located in the top right of your design dashboard allows you to copy a project and all of its components into a completely new design project. All revisions and designs associated with what you are cloning get copied over.

Say you want to build an amphibious car but you have two ideas for the end results: one that has the ability to go underwater and one that only floats on the top. Cloning the base model of the amphibious car would allow you to build out both ideas from the original project.
